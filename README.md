# Welcome to Qlytics Interview

This repository is designed to test out your English, programming, and git version management skills. The length of the test will be approximately 20 minutes, during which, you will be required to write programs, commit changes by following the instructions. You are free to consult any resources for help during the test.

To start, please fork this repository to your own account (register if you don't have an account on github), and clone it on your computer. Open up your text editor and terminal, work on the following tasks.

## Task 1. Create a simple file

Create a branch named "candidate" (without the quotes).

Create a text file at the root of the repository, and fill it with your github user name. Name it the same as your github user name.

Commit this file to your branch.

## Task 2. Remove a file

There is a file named "file.pyc" under "module1" folder. Remove this file by using a .gitignore pattern.

Commit the changes.

## Task 3. Python programming: simplify a function

Open "simplify.py" and try to simplify the functions in it without altering the logic and purpose of the function. You may add or remove functions and import modules where you see fit.

Commit the changes.

## Task 4. Python programming: text processing

Open "text.py" and try to complete the function named `process` and prevent the assertion error from occurring when running this program.

Commit the changes.

## Task 5. Create a Pull Request

Push your changes to your own repository.

From your own github repository home, create and send a new pull request to merge your changes to the master branch of this repository. Your request will be rejected, however, that's how we review your task accomplishments.

That's it, thank you for participating in this interview test!
